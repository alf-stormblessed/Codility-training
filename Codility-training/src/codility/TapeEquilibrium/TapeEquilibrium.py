Problem description:
https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/

A:  each element of array A is an integer within the range âˆ’1000 to 1000
N = len(A) is an integer within the range 2 - 100000
expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage
